 # Jordan Peterson Random Advice Generator

This is a portfolio assignment from Codecademy designed to bring together all the skills that have been learned so far in the course. The goal of the project
was to make a script that would randomly generate a message from three different components strung together. I took it a step further so that the user can get a 
comepletely random message, or get more specific advice based on what question is asked (Only two specific questions are possible). I chose to make a Jordan Peterson advice generator
using some of his (short) well known quotes, and combining them with phrases that he typically uses alot.
